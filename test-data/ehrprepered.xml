      You speak an infinite deal of nothing.
      These violent delights have violent ends
      And in their triump die, like fire and powder
      Which, as they kiss, consume

      Admit impediments. Love is not love
      Which alters when it alteration finds,
      Or bends with the remover to remove.

      That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
      It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
      Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
      Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
      Within his bending sickle's compass come;
      Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
      But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
      If this be error and upon me proved,
      I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
